## 🧩 Assignments Overview

### 1. Descriptive Analytics & Data Preprocessing
**Objective:** Analyze numerical and categorical data, visualize distributions, and preprocess for further analysis.  
**Tasks:**
- Compute mean, median, mode, standard deviation for numerical columns.
- Visualize distributions using histograms, boxplots, and bar charts.
- Standardize numerical variables (z-score normalization).
- Convert categorical variables to dummy variables (one-hot encoding).  
**Key Skills:** Data preprocessing, descriptive statistics, visualization, standardization, one-hot encoding.

### 2. Estimation & Confidence Intervals
**Scenario:** Durability study of print-heads.  
**Objective:** Construct 99% confidence intervals for the mean durability using sample and population standard deviations.  
**Tasks:**
- Build confidence intervals using sample standard deviation (t-distribution).  
- Build confidence intervals using known population standard deviation.  
**Key Skills:** Confidence intervals, t-distribution, inferential statistics.

### 3. Chi-Square Test
**Scenario:** Association between smart home device type and customer satisfaction.  
**Objective:** Determine if there is a significant association between device type and satisfaction using the Chi-Square test for independence.  
**Tasks:**
- State hypotheses (null and alternative).  
- Compute Chi-Square statistic.  
- Compare against critical value and make a decision.  
**Key Skills:** Categorical data analysis, Chi-Square test, hypothesis testing.

### 4. Hypothesis Testing
**Scenario:** Operating cost analysis of restaurants.  
**Objective:** Investigate whether weekly operating costs are higher than the theoretical model using hypothesis testing.  
**Tasks:**
- State hypotheses.  
- Calculate test statistic (t or Z as appropriate).  
- Determine critical value and make a decision.  
- Conclude whether evidence supports the claim.  
**Key Skills:** Hypothesis formulation, statistical testing, decision making.
